# In-Vehicle Recommender System

This GitHub repository is for the In-Vehicle Recommender System Competition. In this project, we worked on creating a a predictive model that involved an in-vehicle recommender system. The goal is to predict whether a driver will accept a recommended coupon based on the current context.

## Project Overview

This project involved several phases of the predictive modeling pipeline, including problem definition, data exploration and processing, modeling, and result interpretation. The main objectives are to practice the full pipeline and effectively explain the obtained results.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with the end-to-end predictive modeling pipeline. This involves data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, optimization, and result interpretation.

## Output

- Problem Definition (business and data science context)
- Data Exploration and Processing (data exploration, error correction, feature engineering)
- Modeling (model selection, hyper-parameter tuning)
- Experimental Setup (variable selection, resampling, cross-validation, evaluation metrics)
- Result and Interpretation (model scoring, variable importance, result explanation)
